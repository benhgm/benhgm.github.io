                    I am working as a machine learning engineer for autonomous driving systems. My job involves studying state of the art deep learning models and development deep neural networks for autonomous driving appplications. Before, I was working in the aviation industry as an engineering services engineer.

                    I started learning to kayak in 2014 after joining the canoe sprint team in my university. Initially, the idea was to use it as a way to stay fit. However, after attending a couple of training sessions and dedicating some time to it, I fell in love with the sport and have never stopped paddling since.

            <h2>Learning Spanish</h2>
            <p>
                I started learning spanish in 2016 while on ERASMUS in Spain.
                It helped me communicate better with the locals and helped me understand spanish culture more.
                Since coming back to Singapore, I'm always looking out for opportunities to practice. I'm currently taking online classes using an app called iTalki.
